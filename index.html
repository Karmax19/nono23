    <h1>Project Proposal: Bhutan - The Land of Happiness</h1>
    <p>In this solo personal project, I aim to enhance the existing Bhutan website, celebrating the country's unique blend of ancient traditions and modern transitions. Bhutan, nestled in the eastern Himalayas, exudes captivating beauty and cultural richness.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>The primary goals of this project are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an engaging website that transports visitors to Bhutan's serene monasteries, breathtaking landscapes, and spiritual depth.</li>
        <li>Provide articles, images, and videos that educate users about Bhutan's history, traditions, and landmarks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>The scope includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refining existing HTML code for improved structure and readability.</li>
        <li>Enhancing content with descriptive text and relevant images.</li>
        <li>Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Choose the GNU License?</h2>
    <p>I've opted for the GNU General Public License (GPL) for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Copyleft Nature:</strong> The GPL ensures that improvements and modifications are shared back with the community. This fosters a culture of sharing and continuous improvement in the development of your software.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source Commitment:</strong> By using the GPL, I contribute to the free software movement, promoting transparency, collaboration, and user freedom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>I have completed both the Proposal and the actual project.</p>
